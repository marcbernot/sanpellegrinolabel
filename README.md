It happens it is the result of the superposition of two very simple patterns.

To discover what are these two patterns, you can either reproduce the notebook of this repository or read it [here (complete with images)](https://deepnote.com/@marc-bernot/San-Pellegrino-label-moire-effect-sWIn2nYPSeuvU7na8_SxBQ) (or squint at the label).
